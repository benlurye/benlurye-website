                <h2>I am...</h2>
            <p>...a singer, actor, and teaching artist who has worked with some of the best regional theatres, small orchestras, and arts education organizations in the country.<br><br>A classically trained tenor, I hold a BM from the University of Maryland and have spent the last 10+ years working with students of all ages, abilities, and levels of interest.<br><br>I started my private studio in 2017, with a mix of amateur and professional students. My high-school aged students have have been accepted to theater programs at NYU, JMU, Elon, Indiana, Ball State, Baldwin Wallace, Penn State, and Pace, and my professional students regularly perform at excellent regional houses, like DC's Shakespeare Theatre Company, 1st Stage, Adventure Theatre MTC, NextStop Theatre, Monumental Theatre Company, and Rep Stage.<p>

            <div id="studio_you"><h2>My students are...</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>seasoned pros working to revamp their audition books, or to prepare material for a specific performance or audition</li>
                    <li>high schoolers preparing for college (and occasionaly professional) auditions</li>
                    <li>perhaps interested in music theory or composition (understanding theory makes everything easier--trust me!)</li>
                    <li>classically-trained performers wanting to dip their toes into the musical theater or pop world, or vice versa</li>
                    <li>from outside the professional performing world, wanting to sing for fun and relaxation</li>

            <h2>What we'll do together</h2>
            <p>After assessing your short- and long-term goals, together we will decide on our areas of focus:<br><br>
                breath, posture, and resonance | repertoire selection | interpretation | music theory | audition preparation |<br> mental and physical stress and tension reduction techniques | vocal stamina<br><br>
                I am based in Brooklyn, and am currently scheduling online lessons through Zoom. As soon as conditions allow, I will hold in-person sessions in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn and continue online sessions as necessary, as well.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2><a id="contact_studio" href="mailto:benlurye@gmail.com">Contact me</a> with any questions or to schedule a trial session.</h2>

            <p>"Your insightful feedback quickly honed in on important points and immediately enabled the singers to make changes -- both by giving them a concrete focus and by giving them space to enact those ideas. I especially enjoyed witnessing the subtle-but-significant shifts in their ability to connect to the emotional lives of the pieces. You allowed them to experience the same type of honesty and clarity that I have seen from you onstage."<br><span>Stacey Mastrian, Voice Teacher and Studio Owner, Mindful Vocal Engineering and Mastroianni Musica</span></p>
            <!--<p>“Ben is a fantastic educator and musician! Our students at Adventure Theatre always look forward to their music classes with him. He goes above and beyond to make sure the students have a positive, fun, and safe experience.”<br><span>Corey Bales, Secondary Education Program Manager, Adventure Theatre MTC</span></p>-->
