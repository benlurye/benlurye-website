This is my personal website; coded entirely from scratch. Took about 1.5 mos to write and upload, although about a week and a half of that time was spent waiting 
for the domain transfer between Dynamod and Google Domains to occur and then figuring out how to host it (first tried on GCP before realizing GH was way, way, easier).
