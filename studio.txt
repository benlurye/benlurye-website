                    I can help you connect the dots.   (maybe a bar image of a score with lots of dots?)

A classically trained tenor, I hold a BM from the University of Maryland and have spent the last 10+ years working with students of all ages, abilities, and levels of interest.

Since 2009 I have taught vocal music for Imagination Stage, Adventure Theatre MTC, and Young Artists of America.

I started my private studio in 2017, with a mix of amateur and professional students. My high-school aged students have have been accepted top MT programs across the country, and my professional students regularly perform at excellent regional houses, like DC's Shakespeare Theatre Company, 1st Stage, Adventure Theatre MTC, NextStop Theatre, Monumental Theatre Company, and Rep Stage.

WHY STUDY WITH ME?

Ever wonder why Kristen Chenoweth can sing both THIS (Sally Brown) and THIS (cunegonde)? It's because she has impeccible classical tecnhique. But, if art songs and arias aren't your thing, don't worry! There's so much contemporary music being written for classically-trained voices--much more than you might realize!
